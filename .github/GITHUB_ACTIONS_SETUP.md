# GitHub Actions Setup for RandomCorp

This document explains how to set up GitHub Actions for automated deployment of RandomCorp to Linode LKE.

## Required GitHub Secrets

You need to configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

### 1. Docker Hub Credentials
- `DOCKER_USERNAME` - Your Docker Hub username
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD` - Your Docker Hub password or access token

### 2. Linode API Token
- `LINODE_TOKEN` - Your Linode API token with full access

### 3. GitHub Token (Automatic)
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Automatically provided by GitHub Actions

## Setting Up GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. In the left sidebar, click "Secrets and variables" ‚Üí "Actions"
4. Click "New repository secret" for each required secret

### Getting Your Linode API Token

1. Log in to [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com/)
2. Click on your profile ‚Üí "API Tokens"
3. Click "Create a Personal Access Token"
4. Give it a descriptive label like "RandomCorp GitHub Actions"
5. Set expiration (or no expiration for persistent deployment)
6. Grant the following permissions:
   - **Account**: Read/Write
   - **Domains**: Read/Write
   - **Events**: Read Only
   - **Images**: Read/Write
   - **IPs**: Read/Write
   - **Kubernetes**: Read/Write
   - **Linodes**: Read/Write
   - **NodeBalancers**: Read/Write
   - **Object Storage**: Read/Write
   - **StackScripts**: Read/Write
   - **Volumes**: Read/Write
7. Click "Create Token"
8. Copy the token immediately (you won't see it again)

### Getting Docker Hub Credentials

1. Log in to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
2. Go to Account Settings ‚Üí Security
3. Click "New Access Token"
4. Give it a descriptive name like "RandomCorp GitHub Actions"
5. Select appropriate permissions (Read/Write for your repositories)
6. Click "Generate"
7. Copy the access token

## Workflow Features

The GitHub Actions workflow includes:

### üèóÔ∏è Build Process
- Builds both API and Frontend Docker images
- Multi-platform builds (AMD64 and ARM64)
- Automatic image tagging with git SHA and branch
- Docker layer caching for faster builds

### üöÄ Infrastructure Management
- Creates Linode LKE cluster if it doesn't exist
- Installs NGINX Ingress Controller
- Sets up Flux CD for GitOps

### üì¶ Deployment Process
- Updates Helm values with new image tags
- Commits changes back to repository
- Waits for Flux to reconcile and deploy
- Verifies deployment health

### üîç Verification
- Checks pod status
- Tests API health endpoints
- Provides access information
- Creates deployment summary

## Manual Trigger

You can manually trigger the deployment by:

1. Going to the "Actions" tab in your repository
2. Selecting "Deploy RandomCorp to LKE"
3. Clicking "Run workflow"
4. Optionally checking "Force rebuild all images"

## Automatic Triggers

The workflow automatically runs on:
- Push to `main` or `master` branch
- Pull requests to `main` or `master` branch

## Expected Runtime

- **First deployment**: ~15-20 minutes (includes cluster creation)
- **Subsequent deployments**: ~5-10 minutes (cluster already exists)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Linode API Token Issues**
   - Ensure token has all required permissions
   - Check token hasn't expired
   - Verify account has sufficient credits

2. **Docker Hub Issues**
   - Verify credentials are correct
   - Check repository permissions
   - Ensure rate limits aren't exceeded

3. **Kubernetes Issues**
   - Check cluster status in Linode Cloud Manager
   - Verify ingress controller is running
   - Check pod logs for errors

### Debugging Steps

1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
2. Use `kubectl` commands in the workflow to inspect resources
3. Check Flux status: `flux get all`
4. Verify Helm releases: `helm list -A`

## Security Considerations

- Secrets are encrypted and only accessible during workflow execution
- API tokens should have minimal required permissions
- Consider using short-lived tokens for enhanced security
- Regularly rotate access tokens

## Cost Optimization

The LKE cluster includes auto-scaling:
- **Minimum**: 3 nodes (g6-standard-2)
- **Maximum**: 10 nodes
- **Auto-scaling**: Based on resource usage

Monitor your Linode costs and adjust node types/counts as needed.
