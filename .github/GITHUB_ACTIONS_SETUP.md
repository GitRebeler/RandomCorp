# GitHub Actions Setup for RandomCorp

This document explains how to set up GitHub Actions for automated deployment of RandomCorp to Linode LKE.

## Required GitHub Secrets

You need to configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

### 1. Docker Hub Credentials
- `DOCKER_USERNAME` - Your Docker Hub username
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD` - Your Docker Hub password or access token

### 2. Linode API Token
- `LINODE_TOKEN` - Your Linode API token with full access

### 3. GitHub Token (Automatic)
- `GH_TOKEN` - Automatically provided by GitHub Actions

## Setting Up GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. In the left sidebar, click "Secrets and variables" ‚Üí "Actions"
4. Click "New repository secret" for each required secret

### Getting Your Linode API Token

1. Log in to [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com/)
2. Click on your profile ‚Üí "API Tokens"
3. Click "Create a Personal Access Token"
4. Give it a descriptive label like "RandomCorp GitHub Actions"
5. Set expiration (or no expiration for persistent deployment)
6. Grant the following permissions:
   - **Account**: Read/Write
   - **Domains**: Read/Write
   - **Events**: Read Only
   - **Images**: Read/Write
   - **IPs**: Read/Write
   - **Kubernetes**: Read/Write
   - **Linodes**: Read/Write
   - **NodeBalancers**: Read/Write
   - **Object Storage**: Read/Write
   - **StackScripts**: Read/Write
   - **Volumes**: Read/Write
7. Click "Create Token"
8. Copy the token immediately (you won't see it again)

### Getting Docker Hub Credentials

1. Log in to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
2. Go to Account Settings ‚Üí Security
3. Click "New Access Token"
4. Give it a descriptive name like "RandomCorp GitHub Actions"
5. Select appropriate permissions (Read/Write for your repositories)
6. Click "Generate"
7. Copy the access token

## Workflow Features

The GitHub Actions workflow includes:

### üèóÔ∏è Build Process
- Builds both API and Frontend Docker images
- Multi-platform builds (AMD64 and ARM64)
- Automatic image tagging with git SHA and branch
- Docker layer caching for faster builds

### üöÄ Infrastructure Management
- **Smart cluster detection**: Automatically detects existing LKE clusters
- **Conditional Terraform**: Only runs Terraform if cluster doesn't exist
- **Seamless integration**: Works with both new and existing clusters
- Installs NGINX Ingress Controller
- Sets up Flux CD for GitOps

### üì¶ Deployment Process
- Updates Helm values with new image tags
- Commits changes back to repository
- Waits for Flux to reconcile and deploy
- Verifies deployment health

### üîç Verification
- Checks pod status
- Tests API health endpoints
- Provides access information
- Creates deployment summary

## Manual Trigger

You can manually trigger the deployment by:

1. Going to the "Actions" tab in your repository
2. Selecting "Deploy RandomCorp to LKE"
3. Clicking "Run workflow"
4. Optionally checking "Force rebuild all images"

## Automatic Triggers

The workflow automatically runs on:
- Push to `main` or `master` branch (excluding Helm values and documentation)
- Pull requests to `main` or `master` branch

### Loop Prevention
The workflow includes multiple safeguards to prevent infinite loops:
- **Path exclusions**: Ignores changes to `helm-charts/**/values.yaml`
- **Skip CI tags**: Automation commits include `[skip ci]` 
- **Smart detection**: Checks if previous commit was automation-generated
- **Documentation exclusions**: Ignores `.md` file changes

## Expected Runtime

- **First deployment (new cluster)**: ~15-20 minutes (includes cluster creation via Terraform)
- **Deployment to existing cluster**: ~3-5 minutes (skips Terraform entirely)
- **Subsequent deployments**: ~5-10 minutes (depends on cluster state)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Linode API Token Issues**
   - Ensure token has all required permissions
   - Check token hasn't expired
   - Verify account has sufficient credits

2. **Docker Hub Issues**
   - Verify credentials are correct
   - Check repository permissions
   - Ensure rate limits aren't exceeded

3. **Kubernetes Issues**
   - Check cluster status in Linode Cloud Manager
   - Verify ingress controller is running
   - Check pod logs for errors

4. **NGINX 404 Issues (IP Access)**
   - **Root cause**: Ingress may not be properly configured for direct IP access
   - **Check ingress**: Run `kubectl get ingress -A` to verify ingress rules
   - **Check services**: Run `kubectl get services -A` to verify backend services
   - **Check pods**: Run `kubectl get pods -A` to ensure application pods are running
   - **Test with domain**: Try accessing via `http://randomcorp.local` (add to hosts file first)
   - **Backend health**: Test API directly: `curl http://INGRESS_IP/api/health`

5. **Terraform Issues**
   - **"Must be unique" error**: This is now avoided by checking for existing clusters first
   - **Skipped entirely**: If cluster exists, Terraform steps are automatically skipped
   - **Only runs when needed**: Terraform only executes for new cluster creation

5. **Pipeline Loop Prevention**
   - **Path exclusions**: Workflow ignores changes to `helm-charts/**/values.yaml` to prevent loops
   - **Skip CI commits**: Automation commits include `[skip ci]` to prevent re-triggering
   - **Smart detection**: Checks commit history to avoid unnecessary runs
   - **Documentation ignored**: Changes to `.md` files don't trigger deployments

### Existing Cluster Handling

The workflow intelligently handles existing LKE clusters:
- **Automatic detection**: Checks Linode API for clusters with matching names
- **Skip Terraform**: If cluster exists, bypasses all Terraform steps completely
- **Direct connection**: Downloads kubeconfig directly from Linode API
- **Zero conflicts**: No state management issues or "unique" errors
- **Fast deployment**: Existing clusters deploy 3x faster by skipping infrastructure setup

### Debugging Steps

1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
2. Use `kubectl` commands in the workflow to inspect resources
3. Check Flux status: `flux get all`
4. Verify Helm releases: `helm list -A`

### Specific Issue: NGINX 404 on Direct IP Access

If you're getting 404 errors when accessing the ingress IP directly:

#### Quick Diagnosis
```bash
# 1. Check if ingress is deployed
kubectl get ingress -A

# 2. Check if services exist
kubectl get services -A

# 3. Check if pods are running
kubectl get pods -A

# 4. Check ingress controller logs
kubectl logs -n ingress-nginx deployment/ingress-nginx-controller

# 5. Test API endpoint directly
curl http://45.79.63.243/api/health
```

#### Common Solutions
1. **Use domain instead of IP**: Add `45.79.63.243 randomcorp.local` to your hosts file
2. **Wait for deployment**: Applications may still be starting up
3. **Check Flux sync**: Run `kubectl get helmrelease -A` to see deployment status
4. **Verify ingress rules**: The ingress should have both domain and IP-based rules

#### Expected Behavior
- `http://45.79.63.243/` ‚Üí Frontend application
- `http://45.79.63.243/api/health` ‚Üí API health check
- `http://randomcorp.local/` ‚Üí Frontend (with hosts file entry)

## Security Considerations

- Secrets are encrypted and only accessible during workflow execution
- API tokens should have minimal required permissions
- Consider using short-lived tokens for enhanced security
- Regularly rotate access tokens

## Cost Optimization

The LKE cluster includes auto-scaling:
- **Minimum**: 3 nodes (g6-standard-2)
- **Maximum**: 10 nodes
- **Auto-scaling**: Based on resource usage

Monitor your Linode costs and adjust node types/counts as needed...
